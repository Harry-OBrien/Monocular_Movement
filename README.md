# Monocular Movement
This is my 3rd year project in which I attempt to create a micro-quadcopter that is capable of stable
flight with a single camera as its only sensory input. The aim is to produce the foundation of a
device that use as little power as possible for flight. 

### Development Process
I will develop this project in 2 stages the first being an implementation on a ground vehicle, the
second being on an aerial vehicle.

The algorithm will use a combination of SLAM, object avoidence and optical flow to achieve its goal.
